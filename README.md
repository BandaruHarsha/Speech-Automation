Speech-Automation
=================

With this application installed in the mobile we can able to control the electrical devices with some electronics 
components such as switches .... we need to install the GPS module to the electrical device with a Sim  ..... 
after the mobile application gets installed in the mobile all the thing is you need to tap the button and speak 
such as LIGHTS OFF or LIGHTS ON  then with the help of the microphone which is present in the  mobile the speech 
gets recorded and nd displayed on the screen, the message is sent only when the text matches to the given text 
in java code i.e LIGHT OFF , then it will send a message to the gps module with the another aim hence the switch 
gets activated or De-activated ..... 

Basically the application is build for the automation of home or office or any where , all thing is you have to download 
the .apk file from the github and install it in your mobile  

For testing purpose you can have to  hold the talk button and then talk as light on....if the same thing is displayed on 
the screen then the application will directly send a message to the Concerned sim which is installed in the GSM module

For changing the sim number in the application , all thing you have to do is download the zip file and open the talk.java 
file and find the number 7416628323and replace the number with your GSM module sim number and then save it it will 
directly sve and again reinstall the application then the application will send a message to the the replaced sim number,
when the string matches in the GSM module it will trigg the switch and then the switch gets activated and the light is on.
