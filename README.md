Speech-Automation
=================

With this application installed on yout mobile, you can control the electrical devices with electronics 
components such as switches. All you need to do is, to install the GPS module to the electrical device with a SIM. 
After the mobile application is installed on your mobile all you need do is, to tap the button and send commands
like "LIGHTS OFF", "LIGHTS ON". This is done with the help of your mobile microphone. Your speech gets recognised,
is recorded and displayed on the screen. The message is sent only when the command matches to command set 
in java code, for example, "LIGHT OFF". A message is sent to the gps module with the another SIM. This is how the switch 
gets activated or de-activated.

The application is futuristic and seeks to build on the current trend of automation of home, office appliances. All you have to do is
download the .apk file from this github repository and install it on your smartphone.  

For testing purpose, you can hold the green button and give the command: "LIGHTS ON". Once the audio is intercepted correctly,
the spoken command is displayed on the screen and the application sends a message to the SIM installed in the GSM module.

To change the sim number in the application, you can download the zip file and open the talk.java file. 
In this file you should find the number "7416628323" and replace it with the desired number. Save changes in the talk.java file. 
Re-install the application. Now the application will send a message to the the new SIM number.
